# EcoVision_2
The overall project was a combination of a grad student’s dissertation as well as an app that would be sold on the market. It’s purpose was to aid in the conversation between different groups of people with different interest and trying to come to a conclusion. We used multiple iPads that would show data to multiple users and the app could be a used for a tool during discussion.  The matter at hand was to create a plan for the city’s green infrastructure budget which would aid in the rampant flooding problem in the city. The two groups were having a discussion would be ordinary citizens and government workers and in the end they would come up with a new plan that would serve both their needs. I had the task of improving the part of the application where they would create a new plan.  The two groups would take a picture of a physical grid with physical tokens which looks similar to a board game. The app would then take that picture and get the information needed for a simulation and then they would use that new simulation and further discuss more options. This part of the process is called EcoVision.

My role was to create a more market ready version of EcoVision. The past application was not very intuitive to users and no error checking so I created a more polished version with tutorials and other features that would assist in making the process smoother.
